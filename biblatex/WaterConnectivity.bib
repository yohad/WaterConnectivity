	abstract = {Habitat and species richness in drylands are affected by the dynamics of a few key species, termed ‘‘ecosystem engineers.’’ These species modulate the landscape and redistribute the water resources so as to allow the introduction of other species. A mathematical model is developed for a pair of ecosystem engineers commonly found in drylands: plants forming vegetation patterns and cyanobacteria forming soil crusts. The model highlights conditions for habitat creation and for high habitat richness, and suggests a novel mechanism for species loss events as a result of environmental changes.},

	abstract = {Understanding the structure and dynamics of plant communities in water-limited systems often calls for the identification of ecosystem engineers—key species that modify the landscape, redistribute resources and facilitate the growth of other species. Shrubs are excellent examples; they self-organize to form patterns of mesic patches which provide habitats for herbaceous species. In this paper we present a mathematical model for studying ecosystem engineering by woody plant species in drylands. The model captures various feedbacks between biomass and water including water uptake by plants’ roots and increased water infiltration at vegetation patches. Both the uptake and the infiltration feedbacks act as mechanisms for vegetation pattern formation, but have opposite effects on the water resource; the former depletes the soil-water content under a vegetation patch, whereas the latter acts to increase it. Varying the relative strength of the two feedbacks we find a trade-off between the engineering capacity of a plant species and its resilience to disturbances. We further identify two basic soil-water distributions associated with engineering at the single patch level, hump-shaped and ring-shaped, and discuss the niches they form for herbaceous species. Finally, we study how pattern transitions at the landscape level feedback to the single patch level by affecting engineering strength.},

	abstract = {Spatial patterns are ubiquitous in animate matter. Besides their intricate structure and beauty they generally play functional roles. The capacity of living systems to remain functional in changing environments is a question of utmost importance, but its intimate relationship to pattern formation is largely unexplored. Here, we address this relationship using dryland vegetation as a case study. Following a brief introduction to pattern-formation theory, we describe a mathematical model that captures several mechanisms of vegetation pattern formation and discuss ecological contexts that showcase different mechanisms. Using this model, we unravel the different vegetation patterns that keep dryland ecosystems viable along the rainfall gradient, identify multistability ranges where fronts separating domains of alternative stable states exist, and highlight the roles of front dynamics in mitigating or reversing desertification. The utility of satellite images in testing model predictions is discussed. An outlook on outstanding open problems concludes this paper.},

	abstract = {Little attention has been directed to the study of soil flow and the complex relationships among energy water and soil flow in terrestrial ecosystems. Soil plays an important role in arid ecosystems. After water soil is the second key factor in the development of an arid ecosystem since soil is the only part of the system capable of absorbing and storing water and nutrients during the hot and long summer period. The present work presents a case study of an ecological soil flow chain in an arid environment and analyses the relationship between this chain and the energy and water flow chains. The study was conducted at the Sde Boqer experiment site located in the northern Negev of Israel where average annual rainfall is 92 mn. Data collected during five consecutive years show that the soil movement process within the ecosystem studied cannot be considered as a purely physical phenomenon, but rather as a part of a complex system in which the burrowing and digging activity of Isopods and Porcupines plays an important role by providing disaggregated soil particles easy to remove by shallow flows. Although controlled by the spatial distribution of soil moisture the biological activity acts as a regulator of soil depth and thus of soil moisture. If this regulating role is deleted from the system a new ecosystem, more arid, can be expected to develop. It is therefore concluded that the study of state and flow variables of an arid ecosystem should consider altogether the water, soil, energy and mineral chains.},

A simple model of plant and water dynamics based on ecologically realistic assumptions and with reasonable parameter values captures both of these types of patterns. The regular patterns result from a Turing-like instability; the irregular patterns arise when the ecological dynamics amplify slight small-scale topographic variability. Because of the close agreement between observations and these theoretical results, this system provides a clear example of how nonlinear mechanisms can be important in determining the spatial structure of plant communities.},

	abstract = {Dryland ecosystems are often characterized by patchy vegetation and exposed soil. This structure enhances transport of soil resources and seeds through the landscape (primarily by wind and water, but also by animals), thus emphasizing the importance of connectivity – given its relation to the flow of these materials – as a component of dryland ecosystem function. We argue that, as with the fertile-islands conceptual model before it, the concept of connectivity explains many phenomena observed in drylands. Further, it serves as an organizing principle to understand dryland structure and function at scales from individual plants to entire landscapes. The concept of connectivity also helps to organize thinking about interactions among processes occurring at different scales, such as when processes at one scale are overridden by processes at another. In these cases, we suggest that state change occurs when fine-scale processes fail to adjust to new external conditions through resource use or redistribution at the finer scale. The connectivity framework has practical implications for land management, especially with respect to decision making concerning the scale and location of agricultural production or habitat restoration in the world's drylands.},

	abstract = {A continuum model for vegetation patterns in water limited systems is presented. The model involves two variables, the vegetation biomass density and the soil water density, and takes into account positive feedback relations between the two. The model predicts transitions from bare-soil at low precipitation to homogeneous vegetation at high precipitation through intermediate states of spot, stripe and gap patterns. It also predicts the appearance of ring-like shapes as transient forms toward asymptotic stripes. All these patterns have been identiﬁed in observations made on two types of perennial grasses in the Northern Negev. Another prediction of the model is the existence of wide precipitation ranges where diﬀerent stable states coexist, e.g. a bare soil state and a spot pattern, a spot pattern and a stripe pattern, and so on. This result suggests the interpretation of desertiﬁcation followed by recovery as an hysteresis loop and sheds light on the irreversibility of desertiﬁcation.},
